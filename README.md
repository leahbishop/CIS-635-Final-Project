# Predicting Cardiovascular Disease

## Description
This is a final group project for CIS 635 - Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining at Grand Valley State University. The goal of this project was to use a public dataset to build a supervised learning model to predict the presense or absense of cardiovascular disease and identify top risk factors for the disease. This repository contains the project proposal, final project report, and full code developed in GoogleColaboratory. Please note this project utilizes a dummy dataset from Kaggle.com. 

## My Contribution
I implemented the Exploratory Data Analysis, Logisitc Regression, and Decision Tree sections of this project in addition to sections of the project proposal and final project report.
